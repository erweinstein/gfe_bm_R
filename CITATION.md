# How to cite

This folder is an R translation, by Eliot R. Weinstein, of the replication code for

> Bonhomme, Stéphane and Elena Manresa (2015), "Grouped Patterns of Heterogeneity
> in Panel Data," *Econometrica* 83(3), 1147–1184. doi:10.3982/ECTA11319

The grouped fixed-effects estimator, its theory, the computational algorithms,
the empirical application, and the original MATLAB, Fortran, and Stata code are
the work of Stéphane Bonhomme and Elena Manresa. If you use this code, cite their
paper (and its Supplementary Appendix, which contains the algorithms, the
fixed-T variance, the Monte Carlo design, and the extensions):

```bibtex
